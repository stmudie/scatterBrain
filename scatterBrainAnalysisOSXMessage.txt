This version adds an auto update checker on startup. By default this is enabled (unless you are upgrading from the short lived 1.35 version). You can turn it on and off in the Settings->General Settings page. I recommend you leave it on so you are notified of new versions as they become available. However, if you are running your computer offline, or the AS website is down, then you will get a short pause at start up as the checker tries to connect to the server. If you find this pause annoying then you will always be able to stop the auto update checker using the Settings->General Settings page

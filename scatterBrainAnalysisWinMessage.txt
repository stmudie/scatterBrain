You can plot DAT files directly. Use Tools->Dat File Mode.

Fix for export profiles. Add export logfile under tools menu. Exporting direct to Excel works, but is very slow. Hence I recommend using the export the CSV (comma separated values) and then importing this directly into whatever viewer you want to use.
